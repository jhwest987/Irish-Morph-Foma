# Irish-Morph-Foma

This project uses foma (https://code.google.com/archive/p/foma/) to implement a finite-state morphology that can generate or parse the forms of Irish verbs. Each verb has 49 forms (7 tenses/moods and 7 person/number combinations) except for bí, which has 56. Generated forms match the surface forms of Irish orthography, and parsed forms have the verbal lemma plus morphological tags. For example, 'éireofar' is parsed to 'éirigh+V+Fut+Aut', meaning the autonomous future form.
